I would like to implement a select2 field in flask-admin.

Consider a "To" field in an email. One starts typing an email address and matches show up in a select2 list.   
Click on an email address and it pops in that email address - the exact text of the address, not an Id.   
Next one can start typing another email address so it can be populated into the "To" field as well.    
This can continue as many times as the user needs.

I tried to implement this here: https://github.com/dgleba/flaskplayground/blob/master/28select2-test/fltg.py     
No luck.

I can't say I understand this one...   
https://github.com/Jaza/flasktaggingtest   
   
I got this working, but it is a select and it gets suggestions locally, not from a table.   
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31081516/how-can-i-turn-a-string-model-field-into-a-select-input-in-flask-admin   

1.   
Can I ask this question here?   
If not, where is the suggested place to do so?    

2.   
Can someone point me to examples or documents where I could learn from to do this?   
   
3.   
Can someone help me with this?   


History:   
   
I have been learning Flask-admin for a couple months.    
I have been making small working examples to learn Flask-admin.   
I don't ask this question lightly.   
I have read many hours. I have looked for other examples I can learn from.   
I haven't found something I can learn from to figure this out myself.   
I learn best from examples.   
   
Reference:   
   
Stuff I am writing to learn Flask-admin.

Many thanks in advance.
